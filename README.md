# TI-BASIC Interpreter
This project is currently a work-in-progress.
## About
This project is an interpreter for the TI BASIC programming language. Its purpose is to give TI BASIC developers a way to test their TI BASIC programs on the computer without the requirement of retrieving a ROM image from their calculator. This interpreter will eliminate the current, cumbersome procedure of writing code on the computer, transferring to the calculator, and testing on the calculator. It will also provide more comprehensive error reporting, which will speed up production time for large scale projects.
## Useful Resources
Here is a list of online resources that helped me get jump-started in the process of making this interpreter. If you'looking to learn more about interpreters, these resources are extremely helpful. Thank you to the authors.
